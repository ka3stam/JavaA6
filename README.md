description of a string - position - times repeated

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, 
the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, 
a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself) i.e. σ1(n) = 2n.

This definition is ancient, appearing as early as Euclid's Elements (VII.22) where it is called τέλειος ἀριθμός 
(perfect, ideal, or complete number). 

NewJApplet.java finds the perfect numbers between 2 and 100000. It also shows their proper divisors.
